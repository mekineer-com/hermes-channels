"""Thin sync client for the WhatsApp bridge HTTP API.

Used by soul_mode when the soul's turn contract says
``response_target == "private"``: the bridge's connected account is also
the human's account (Test User sends and the soul sends from the same
number), so PRIVATE means routing the soul's reply to the human's
self-DM (their own number chatting to itself) instead of the chat the
turn came from. WhatsApp surfaces a person under either a phone JID
(``12025550199@s.whatsapp.net``) or a privacy LID (``114628432556258@lid``);
the bridge records both in ``creds.json``'s ``me`` block and the phone
JID is what ``/send`` expects as ``chatId`` for a self-DM.

This module sits alongside ``memu_client.py`` as one of our added files;
it does not import or modify upstream ``gateway/platforms/whatsapp.py``.
